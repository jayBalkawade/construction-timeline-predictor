📊 Predicting Project Completion Timelines with Machine Learning
🚀 Overview
Delays in construction and infrastructure projects can be costly. This project builds a predictive model to estimate project completion timelines based on factors like budget utilization, project type, and agency efficiency. The model helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions, reduce budget overruns, and improve resource allocation.
📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of real-world project details with features such as:
•	Project Start and End Dates
•	Budget and Expenditure Details
•	Agency and Department Information
•	Project Category and Type
⚡ Features & Methodology
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw project data.
✅ Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features from financial metrics and timelines.
✅ Modeling: Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict project completion duration.
✅ Feature Importance: Identified key factors influencing project delays.
🎯 Model Performance
📌 Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 308.41 days
📌 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 568.82 days
📌 R² Score: 92.17%
🔥 Visualization - Feature Importance
The top factors influencing project delays were analyzed using feature importance plots.
🏗️ Future Work
•	Integrate XGBoost for improved accuracy.
•	Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
•	Deploy model for real-time project monitoring.
